**This project is now archived**

So yea.. after a few months of working on this project I have decided to archive it.
I won't stop working on the game itself.. but instead of writing it in plain ol' java I am rewriting this project, this time using libGdx to make the process simpler, and to be able to get to adding the fun stuff quicker, the new repository's name is [RedSponge/Dashni](https://github.com/RedSponge/Dashni).

**old README.md**

A Random platformer by RedSponge :D
